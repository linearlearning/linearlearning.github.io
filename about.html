  In this level, we see two vectors: one on the left and one on the right. The vector on the left is called the input vector. It appears when you click in the left-hand screen. You can move it around with your mouse. Each input vector is assigned an output vector that appears on the right-hand screen. As you move the input vector v around, you can see the output vector move around as well.

  The dots represent possible outputs. Your goal is to try to find the input vector that achieves each output.

  Do you see any patterns in how the output vector moves in response to the input?

<b><font color=magenta>[Explanation]</font></b>
</td>
<td>
  How are the two vectors related? You are free to move the vector on the left however you like, but once you pick its position, there is only one place the output can be. This is a function. In fact, the function you are playing with is a linear transformation.

<td>
If the input vector is v, and the output vector is w, then w = Av for a hidden matrix A. Each time you pick v, the game calculates Av and draws it on the right.
